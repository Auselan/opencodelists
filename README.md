# OpenCodelists

OpenCodelists is a rapidly-changing work in progress.  It will be a platform for the development and dissemination of codelists for use in medical research.

It is part of the [OpenSAFELY](https://opensafely.org) project, and is currently served from [codelists.opensafely.org](https://codelists.opensafely.org).

It hosts codelists used in our paper on [factors associated with COVID-19-related hospital death in the linked electronic health records of 17 million adult NHS patients](https://opensafely.org/outputs/2020/05/covid-risk-factors/).
