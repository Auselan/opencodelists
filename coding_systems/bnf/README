BNF
---

BNF codes are used to identify anything that is prescribed in England (and maybe elsewhere).

For more details, see our most popular blog post [0].

We obtain the raw data from the BSA [1].  New releases are published annually, sometimes
with unannounced mid-year updates.

To import the data, run:

        ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.bnf path/to/dir/
