CTV3
----

CTV3 is a retired system of clinical terms.

It is the successor to Read v2, and is replaced by SNOMED CT.  (The "CT" stands for
"Clinical Terms" in both CTV3 and SNOMED CT.)

No new CTV3 codes are published, although sometimes TPP have published new "Y codes", which look like CTV3 codes.

The last release of CTV3 was on 1st April 2018.  This data is no longer available to
download online, but can be retrieved from the zip file on dokku3:
Add this to the CTV3 data folder on dokku3, at
`/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/opencodelists/data/ctv3/nhs_readctv3_25.0.0_20180401000001.zip`.

CTV3 codes from TPP are extracted from the database by running all the jobs in
[this workspace](https://jobs.opensafely.org/datalab/opensafely-testing/tpp-ctv3-codes/), and
following the [usual process for checking and releasing output files](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/).  The two output files required for importing data into OpenCodelists are named:

- `ctv3_dictionary.csv.gz`
- `ctv3_hierarchy.csv.gz`

Add these to a subfolder labelled with the extracted date, in the CTV3 data folder on dokku3. E.g. if the files were extracted on 28 Nov 2023, add them to
`/var/lib/dokku/data/storage/opencodelists/data/ctv3/2023-11-28/`.

To import the data, run:

    ./manage.py import_coding_system_data ctv3
    path/to/dated/subdir/in/dokku/app
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYY-MM-DD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - include the last official CTV3
  release date plus the date the TPP extensions were extracted.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired. Include at least the extracted date here.

For the example above, the data should be imported with:

    dokku run opencodelists python manage.py import_coding_system_data ctv3
    /storage/data/ctv3/2023-11-28/
    --release '2018-04-01 with TPP extensions 2022-11-28'
    --valid-from 2022-11-28
    --import-ref 'Extracted 2022-11-28'

After importing, restart the opencodelists app with:

    dokku ps:restart opencodelists
