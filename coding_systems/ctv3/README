CTV3
----

CTV3 is a retired system of clinical terms.

It is the successor to Read v2, and is replaced by SNOMED CT.  (The "CT" stands for
"Clinical Terms" in both CTV3 and SNOMED CT.)

No new CTV3 codes are published, although sometimes TPP have published new "Y codes",
which look like CTV3 codes.
