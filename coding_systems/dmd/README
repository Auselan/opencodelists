Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d)
------------------------------------------

dm+d codes are used to identify medicines and devices in use across the NHS.

For more details, see our blog post [0].

We obtain the raw data from TRUD [1].

You will need an account to access TRUD, and may be asked for a reason when you sign up -- if so, mention OpenCodelists.

On the TRUD release page, download the latest release, which will be a zip file called something like nhsbsa_dmd_4.0.0_20220404000001.zip

To import the data, unzip the zip file and run:

        ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.dmd path/to/dir/
