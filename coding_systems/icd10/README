ICD-10
------

ICD-10 is the tenth edition of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases
and Related Health Problems, published by the WHO.

Data was downloaded and imported from [0].  We don't know how often new releases are
published.

Download the latest release.  Select the ClaML format to download (ClaML is a an XML-based format, designed for classifications). It will be downloaded as a zipped .xml file, named e.g.
`icdClaML2019ens.zip`.  In the absence of a more specific release date, we label it as valid from the 1st of the year of release.

The version can be retrieved from the <Title> tag of the XML file.  Usually this is just a year; 2019 includes extra COVID extensions and is labelled 2019-covid-expanded.

To import the data, run:

        ./manage.py import_coding_system_data icd10
        path/to/zip/file/in/dokku/app
        --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYY-MM-DD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the version reference as
  described above.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being
  imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired. Include at least the full downloaded
  zipfile here.

For the example above (`icdClaML2019ens.zip`), the data should be
imported with:

    dokku run opencodelists python manage.py import_coding_system_data icd10
    /storage/data/icd10/icdClaML2019ens.zip
    --release 2019-covid-expanded
    --valid-from 2019-01-01
    --import-ref icdClaML2019ens.zip

After importing, restart the opencodelists app with:

    dokku ps:restart opencodelists
