SNOMED CT
---------

https://www.snomed.org/

SNOMED CT aims to be the "global common language for clinical terms".

There is an interantional release, and various national releases.

New releases are published irregularly -- there was a schedule, but it's been disrupted
by covid.

We obtain the raw data from TRUD [0], and from this we import:

* the International release
* the UK edition
* the UK Clinical Extension

You will need an account to access TRUD, and may be asked for a reason when you sign up -- if so, mention OpenCodelists.

For local testing, you will need your API key.  Find it on your [account page](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud/users/authenticated/filters/0/account/manage), and set the
`TRUD_API_KEY` variable in your local .env file.

To download the data, go to the TRUD release page and identify the latest release, which will be a zip
file called something like uk_sct2cl_32.10.0_20220216000001Z.zip. You don't need to download the file, as it will be retrieved via the API.  The release number can be obtained from the filename.  The TRUD
release page will state the release date, which should be used as the "valid-from" date.  Note that
this is usually a few days after the date in the zip file name (release 32.10.0 has a release date of 23 Feb 2022).

To import the data, run:
    ./manage.py import_coding_system_data snomedct
    path/to/snomedct/download/dir/in/dokku/app
    --release <release_name> --valid-from YYYY-MM-DD --import-ref <ref>

- `release` is a short label for this coding system release - the official version number
  as described above.
- `valid-from` is the date that this release is valid from (NOT the date it is being
  imported into OpenCodelists), in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `import-ref` is an optional long-form reference field for any other potential
  references or comments on this import if desired. Omit it to default to the name
  of the downloaded zipfile.
- `latest`: if importing the latest release, optionally specify --latest.  This will
  retrieve only the latest release from TRUD. It will fail if the release and valid from
  dates provided are not for the latest release.

For the example above (`uk_sct2cl_32.10.0_20220216000001Z.zip`), the data should be
imported with:

    dokku run opencodelists python manage.py import_coding_system_data snomedct \
    /storage/data/snomedct \
    --release 32.10.0 \
    --valid-from 2022-02-23

After importing, restart the opencodelists app with:

    dokku ps:restart opencodelists
