SNOMED CT

SNOMED CT aims to be the "global common language for clinical terms".

There is an interantional release, and various national releases.

New releases are published irregularly -- there was a schedule, but it's been disrupted
by covid.

We obtain the raw data from TRUD [0], and from this we import:

* the International release
* the UK edition
* the UK Clinical Extension

You will need an account to access TRUD, and may be asked for a reason when you sign up -- if so, mention OpenCodelists.

On the TRUD release page, download the latest release, which will be a zip file called something like uk_sct2cl_32.10.0_20220216000001Z.zip.

To import the data, unzip the zip file and run:

        ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.snomedct path/to/dir/SnomedCT_InternationalRF2_PRODUCTION_*
        ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.snomedct path/to/dir/SnomedCT_UKClinicalRF2_PRODUCTION_*
        ./manage.py import_data coding_systems.snomedct path/to/dir/SnomedCT_UKEditionRF2_PRODUCTION_*
