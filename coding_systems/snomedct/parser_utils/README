This directory contains two ANTLR4 grammar files:

* ECL.g4, for the SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Language (from https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomed-ecl-parser)
* ECLsubset.g4, for the subset of the SNOMED CT ECL that can describe a codelist (manually created by deleting things from ECL.g4)

It also contains a generated number helper files to allow the ECLsubset grammar to be
used in Python.

To regenerate these files, run:

    java -jar antlr-4.10.1-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 -visitor -no-listener ECLsubset.g4

The .jar file was downloaded from https://www.antlr.org/download.html
