## Editing a codelist

You can edit a codelist that you have created.
To do this, click *Create new version* on the left hand side of the codelist homepage.

This will open the builder, with all of the codes from your codelist selected.
Additionally, if you created your codelist through the builder,
then any terms you searched for will be present.

You can search for new terms,
and you can change whether any concepts are included or excluded.

You can discard your changes by clicking *Discard changes*.
You can also save a draft version of your codelist by clicking *Save as draft*.
And when all concepts have been resolved,
you can save your changes and create a new version by clicking *Save changes*.

Importantly, the original version of your codelist is still accessible at the same URL.
