## Future plans

Our future plans include:

- improving curation of codelists
- allowing users to record, within the tool, the reasons for their decisions
- adding a system to let users subscribe to a codelist to be notified when it has changed
- making it possible to build a new codelist based on a one that somebody else has made
- building a system to ensure that codelist creators get credit for their work
- and much more
