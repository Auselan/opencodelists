## Status of the project

OpenSAFELY Codelists is in active development.
It's still rough around the edges, but has been used to create {numcodelists} codelists since April 2020.

**Anybody** can use OpenSAFELY Codelists to create and share codelists.

See the section on [future plans](#future-plans) for upcoming features.
