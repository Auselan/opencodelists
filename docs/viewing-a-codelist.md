## Viewing a codelist

The homepage of a codelist shows information about what the codelist contains and how it was created,
as well as links to any references and details of who created the codelist.

The *Full list* tab shows a searchable list of codes and terms.

Most codelists have a *Tree* tab, showing all of the codes in the codelist in the context of other codes in the coding system.
Codes that are not in the codelist are shown greyed out.
This is helpful for seeing whether there are any accidental gaps in the codelist.

For codelists that were created with the builder, there will also be a *Searches* tab,
showing the search terms that were used to create the codelist.

For all codelists, there are links for downloading a CSV of the codelist and a CSV containing a definition of the codelist.

If there are multiple versions of a codelist, links to these will be displayed on the left hand side.
