BNF to DM+D (SNOMED) Mappings
------------------------------------------

dm+d codes are used to identify medicines and devices in use across the NHS.

Codelists are typically built using pseudoBNF and converted to dm+d for use in study definitions.

For more details, see our blog posts [0] and [1].

We obtain the mapping data from the NHS Business Services Authority [2].  New mapping data is released monthly.

On the download page, download the latest release, which will be an zip file called something like `SNOMED - BNF mapping document September 2022.zip`, containing a single
xlsx file.

To import the data, unzip the file and run:

    ./manage.py import_mapping_data mapping.bnfdmd path/to/xlsx/file
