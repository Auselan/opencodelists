## Creating a codelist from a CSV file

As well as creating a codelist from scratch, you can create one by uploading a CSV file.

From the _My codelists_ page, click _Create a codelist_.

Choose a name for the codelist, select a coding system from the dropdown,
and choose a file to upload from your hard drive.  If you are a member of an organisation, you can also choose an owner for the codelist (your own account or an organisation account).

Note that the CSV file should not have a header,
and its first column must contain valid codes in the chosen coding system.
(This limitation will be lifted.)

When you click _Create_ the codelist will be created and you will be taken to the codelist homepage.

From here, you can edit any metadata.
You can also edit the codelist.
